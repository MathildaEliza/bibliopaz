Gilberto tells us:<br>
<i> "I am a cultural manager and promoter of reading with law studies at the Libre University."
<p>"My experience started in the Cultural Corporation Public Library Julio Pérez Ferrero, in the city of Cúcuta Norte de Santander. There I worked developing functions as a tutor and promoter of reading in the Municipal Reading and Writing Network of Cúcuta, led by the City Hall of San José de Cúcuta, which aims to promote reading and writing in children, youth, adults and seniors of the city of Cúcuta, with a particular focus on the populations in vulnerable positions regarding their rights.
</p><p>We managed, within the framework of this important and valuable initiative, to design library extension services for communities in different neighborhoods of Cúcuta, to create innovative activities to promote reading and culture, such as the "Lunadas Literarias" that were recognized as examples for the country by the Ministry of Culture of Colombia. We also were able to design educational and cultural activities around the book and cinema from the "Biblioexpress" (a mobile library that visited the neighborhoods and nearby municipalities of the city of Cúcuta).
</p><p>Also, I am the founder of the Cultural Corporation of Reading and Writing of the municipality Los Patios. I participated in the project of Mobile Public Libraries of the Ministry of Culture in 2017, I was also a librarian in the public libraries project for the paths of peace developed in 2018 by the Ministry of Culture.
</p><p>Currently I work as coordinator of the Cultural Corporation of Reading and Writing that is dedicated to creating strategic reading and writing plans with innovative character.

  <br>
<h4>Where is Conejo?</h4>
The corregimiento Conejo is located in the municipality of Fonseca within the department of La Guajira. It has around 2500 inhabitants and is the largest district of the three that Fonseca has. It has very fertile land, so the main economy is agriculture and livestock. The production of coffee stands out and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fonseca-guajira.gov.co/soyfestivaldelcafe/Paginas/default.aspx"><b>Coffee Festival</b></a>, celebrated every December for 16 years, is famous in the area. Due to its proximity to the Venezuelan border, Conejo was one of the main routes to Venezuela and it was also a region where the guerrillas were furnished with supplies. It was precisely in February 2016 when Conejo received all the international attention because this corregimiento was chosen by the <a target="_blank" href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mav4n/BPMP/Documents/Conejo1Farc.pdf"><b>FARC</b></a> to make public its presence for the first time and to socialize with the troops stationed in this region.

</span>
<i>"When the Mobile Public Library arrived at the hands of Gilberto" It came as a miracle," say its residents, a miracle that has brought together the entire community around books, tablets and computers. The School of Music Vallenata is a nursery where children and young people learn to play accordion, guitar, 'cajón' and guacharaca, In addition, with the help of a group of artists and the community, adorned the streets of the village in color with 20 murals that feature the history of the locality. "</i><br> National Library, September 2018.

<br>
<p><i>"The Ministry of Culture indicated that one of the main projects, since the beginning of the library, was the recovery of the traditions of the town, among them, the love for vallenato. This project stems from the fact that in Conejo several years ago there was a group called the Dinastia Vallenata, which brought together some of the best talent in the area, however, the group had disintegrated and it was thanks to the library that some of its members and heirs of the tradition met again to compose and perform songs alluding to peace, to the people, and to what the library means to the community.
 </p><p>
This resurgence of the group motivated the library and the municipal administration to adapt a space to create the Vallenata Music School of the Conejo Library, a space that has become a hotbed of new talent, where children and young people compose songs and learn to play accordion, guitar, cajón and guacharaca.
  </p><p>
The sense of appropriation shared among the inhabitants of Conejo of its library is reflected in the streets of the corregimiento. A group of artists, with the support of the community, embodied the customs of their people in 20 murals that tell the history of the town, a story that, like a good vallenato, will say that one day a library arrived in their town and the community clung to her so much that she did not let it go.

<h4>The song of the prize: Sin miedo (Without fear)</h4><br>
It's nice the times of yesterday, where there was no violence<br>
Nor was there war, everything was happiness<br>
My God, so much destruction because, <br>
because there is so much sadness<br>
And our mother earth cannot stand more<br>
The mockingbird no longer sings, that child no longer sings<br>
Your neighbor does not tell you good morning like this<br>
Because it is no longer the same of those times gone<br>
And not even on the roads you can walk<br>
You can walk, without fear without fear of dying<br>
Without fear, you can walk the villages<br>
Without fear of having someone kidnap you to kidnap<br>
Now this world is like that, now who can change it<br>
Now this world is like that, now I have to tell you<br>
How sad is this reality, God<br>
You are the king of the world and on earth none<br>
This can achieve, God<br>
You own the world and only in a second<br>
You can achieve, come guerrillas<br>
And all armed group, and holding hands<br>
Come let's look for peace, that tomorrow morning<br>
Listen to the radio, which after so many years<br>
Colombia lives in peace<br>
Without fear without fear of dying<br>
Without fear, you can walk<br>
Without fear, you can walk the villages<br>
Without fear of having someone kidnap you to kidnap<br>
Now this world is like that, now who can change it<br>
Now this world is like that, now I have to tell you<br>
How sad is this reality<br>
 <br>
II<br>
God give me back yesterday's time<br>
Of knee I ask you to light the way<br>
Where there is no evil<br>
Faith moves mountains I know, and here the enemy<br>
The mountains have gone and the mountains return<br>
And live as a brother and live as a friend<br>
Because living together is living in peace<br>
Because it is no longer the same of those times gone<br>
And it is very sad that a child can no longer go to school<br>
 <br>
Without fear without fear of dying<br>
Without fear, you can walk<br>
Without fear, you can walk the villages<br>
Without fear of having someone kidnap you to kidnap<br>

<i>""It was a special song for Peace and a good  show of the progress of the process, it speaks of the joy we all felt when we got up and knew that the war had been changed by reconciliation and that after so many years Colombia finally lives in peace."
