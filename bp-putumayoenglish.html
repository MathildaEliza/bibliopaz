    <h2>Gloria Estella Nupán Cañares</h2>
Gloria was the Librarian for Peace during 2017 in the "vereda" of Carmelitas in the municipality of Puerto Asis
<br>of the department of Putumayo, five hours from the public library that she has run for 25 years,
<br>the Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento Library. It is in the city of La Hormiga
<br>in the municipality of the Guamuez Valley of the department of Putumayo.<br>

<b>Gloria tells us:<br>
"<i>I completed a bachelor's degree in elementary school education with an emphasis in human rights; eight semesters of social and community psychology with the National Open and Distance University. I am a librarian by vocation and a product of the different workshops and training offered by librarians from the National Library and the Ministry of Culture. Belonging to the National Network of public libraries, I know that this system has contributed to linking volunteers who promote reading processes through which the fragmented social fabric is strengthened by the different problems that affect the municipality of Valle del Guamuez and Putumayo department.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
I have been linked to the Luis Carlos Galán Public Library since 1993, where I have had the opportunity to work with different population groups including children, youth, and adults located in rural and urban areas.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
My main objective, as a librarian, has been to encourage dialogue, the proper use of free time, and self-learning and healthy coexistence within the community by various means including reading a book, watching a movie, telling stories and presenting personal experiences. I have not done this work alone, but instead together with the Friends of the Library Group (GAB), which was created in 2004, and with whom we have offered a radio program, a literary magazine and the extension of library services to the most remote areas of the city. From the library we currently have focused on working with early childhood in rural areas.

<h4 id="biblioteca-pública-móvil-las-morras">Gloria, librarian in La Hormiga</h4>
<b>
Gloria <b>ha construido paz </b>desde los 16 años cuando se fue al colegio desde la casa de sus padres situada en una vereda del Valle de Guamuez, cansada del asedio que le producía estar en medio de la guerrilla, los paramilitares y el ejército. Al colegio fue por las noches ya que de día trabajaba en la casa de un amigo de su papa que se convirtió en el alcalde del pueblo y la nombro a ella regenta de un salón en donde se encontraba lo que entonces llamaban "la biblioteca".
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Since 1993, in that "library" she learned to be a professional librarian in a self-styled way, first by following her intuition and then, by taking advantage of all kinds of training support from the Ministry of Culture, especially since 1997 when the "library" became the Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento library. By 2004, when the library collection already exceeded 5,000 books (1 book for every 10 inhabitants) and 200 daily users, the library was integrated into the national network of public libraries. Due to the arrival of the internet [and the paramilitary] those 200 users were reduced to 70. It is at this moment that they decided to take the library to the "veredas" (18 veredas by 2004) where the monthly visits became true cultural events for the small communities.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Her work has not only been among books, but also involves promoting peace by exercising dialogue and healthy coexistence among the community from the "book."
<br>&nbsp;<br>
"<i>Going back to the time I was living there ..." says Jorge Andrés Cancimance, a 27-year-old member of the Library Friends Group--- "I remember that the possibilities the context offered me were being a guerrilla or being a paramilitary. I was a user of the library as a child, the stories and readings encouraged me to look for the possibility to study in Bogotá and so I did ". Today he is a graduate of Social Work at the National University of Colombia</i>".
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Libraries were forced to reduce many services due to the paramilitary control in that area by the Castaño House 'southern block' between 2000-2005. To overcome the vicissitudes of the conflict, libraries had to experiment with new strategies, such as the creation of the Library Friends Group in 2004, founding the magazine Khatarsis (conceived as a space in which people could express "things that the armed conflict did not allow" and that the paramilitaries ignored from the beginning for not being "dangerous"), or founding the radio "Los Hormigueros", which broadcasted cultural programs to promote reading.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
It was necessary to gain space from the war by facilitating alternatives (film forum series, literary gatherings, making open calls for stories about life in the municipality, or offering the possibility to have a radio program dedicated to music, radio theater or the poetry); alternatives especially aimed at children and young people but without attracting attention in order to survive the years of lead.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In 2014 her work, and that of her entire team, including the Library Friends Group, was recognized when they received the prestigious Daniel Samper Ortege National Public Libraries Award in its first year. In turn, Gloria was included among the 100 most influential and transformative women in Colombia.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
All this work contributed to Gloria being invited, at the end of 2016, to participate in the Libraries for Peace project, for which she took a one-year leave of absence from her duties as librarian at La Hormiga and to focus on the dissemination of this Project in the lands of Putumayo.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
First to be deployed was its Mobile Library for Peace in the Transitional Normalization "Veredal" Zone (ZVTN) of La Carmelita in Puerto Asis, Putumayo. To highlight the importance of this project, then President Juan Manuel Santos dignified the event with a personal visit and heard Gloria's report, in which, among other things, she narrated one of the dreams she had had since her youth:
<i>"The dream is always that before an armed man passes through our houses, down our "veredas", through our farms, there goes is a person with books,. "</i>
<br> May it be so and may it last!!!

<h4>Where is the "vereda" <i>Las Carmelitas</i>?</h4>
The village of La Carmelita is in the municipality of Puerto Asís, department of Putumayo. In 2016 this "vereda" became one of the 23 rural areas that served for the concentration and delivery of weapons of the FARC and that today are Territorial Spaces of Training and Reincorporation. During the fall of 2017, Puerto de Asís was one of the first municipalities in the country where land titles to peasants of Putumayo began to be distributed. This distribution was an incentive for the peasants who, after many years of cultivating coca, decided to return to lawfulness by planting legal crops such as cocoa, cane, cassava and pepper. According to government sources, by the end of 2017, about 400 property titles were distributed in Putumayo.

The Mobile Library in the Carmelitas was installed in a building in the center of the Vereda that the inhabitants use for their social events. There the librarians lived for a year with the inhabitants of the village, organizing writing workshops, and promoting reading among young children and adults. There were photography workshops, film cycles, and computer workshops. Campaigns designed at the national level of support were inserted into the community and found a great echo among the users of the Carmelite Library. Significant examples of these campaigns were <a target="_blank" href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mav4n/BPMP/documents/Gloriapazalbosque.pdf"><b><i>"Paz al Bosque" (Peace in the Forest)</i><b></a>,, in which the National Library of Colombia and the Caro y Cuervo Institute joined forces during 2018 to promote social change through creative writing. The campaign <i>"Books, Color and Jungle"</i>, which in addition to providing books for libraries, helped in the spring of 2018 to promote reading among the youngest through stories and poetry.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The most important thing of all is that all these cultural activities helped to promote dialogue ... listening and above all speaking. And it is well known that the well-exercised word helps to heal.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Outstanding in the management of all Mobile Public Libraries for Peace is their ability to create local support groups. These are called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/bpmlacarmelita/posts/"</a><b><i>"Library Friends Group"</i></b></a> and they help to keep the Library alive in the community. The users of the Carmelita library had good luck after all since, for "bureaucratic" reasons Gloria had to leave the management of this library after four months of intense work, since its founding in February 2017. The good luck that helped to mitigate this situation was that Gloria became, at this very moment, one of the most active people in the Library Friends Group, and began working to extend these library services throughout the villages of Putumayo in the national campaign of 2018 called <i>" Public Libraries in the "veredas" and paths of peace.</i>"
<br>&nbsp;<br>
And the Carmelite Library happened to be directed by Luis Alberto Narváez, another of the Librarians for Peace participating in this project.

 <h2 id="biblioteca-pública-móvil-las-morras">A good example why all of this is important</h2>

  <P><i>"Jaime is the war name of a former combatant. He is an indigenous man from the Putumayo and is 45 years old. He entered the FARC when he was 28 years old and never saw his parents again because he was in the mountains. You can clearly see in him the joy of being on the path that leads to being part of civil society.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When he meets Gloria Stella he cannot help but blush a little. The admiration he feels for Prof Stella, as he calls her, translates into a respectful shame.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
He says that a few days ago he received a visit from his mother. That the old woman did not stop crying when she saw him alive, and that he did not know how to comfort her. Until it occurred to him to say that everything was going to be fine because he was learning to read. His mother was stunned. Pablo can already spell and is happy to do so.
<br>
