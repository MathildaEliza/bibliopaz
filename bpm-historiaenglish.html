On January 25, 2017, the Minister of Culture of Colombia, Mariana Garcés, and the High Commissioner for Peace, Sergio Jaramillo, presented the model of Mobile Libraries for Peace that was implemented in 20 Colombian rural areas. The Ministry of Culture purchased the library model from the French NGO Libraries Without Borders, investing two million dollars to acquire the facilities and finance its operation.

As of February 15, 2017, 20 libraries have been installed in villages in the municipalities of Dabeiba, Ituango and Remedios (Antioquia); Arauquita (Arauca); La Montañita and San Vicente del Caguán (Caquetá); Caldono and Miranda (Cauca); La Paz (Cesar); Tierralta (Córdoba); Riosucio (Chocó); San José del Guaviare (Guaviare); Fonseca (La Guajira); La Macarena, Mesetas and Vista Hermosa (Meta); Policarpa and Tumaco (Nariño); Puerto Asís (Putumayo), and Planadas (Tolima).
<p align="left">
Most of these libraries were installed in the so-called transitional normalization zones in the disarmament process with the FARC. The mobile libraries contributed to the building of trust in the communities through cultural content and the dissemination of reading. They contributed to the reconciliation by facilitating public spaces where the community meet to produce culture.

</span><br>
Each library is a <a target="_blank" href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mav4n/BPMP/documents/Multimedia.pdf"><b> multimedia center </b></a> that can be transported on two standard plastic pallets. Within a space of between 50 and 100 square meters, they can cater to up to 50 people. On the other hand, they can be deployed in less than 20 minutes. In terms of content, each one has 380 physical books and more than 200 digital books, as well as 17 tablets, 15 digital book readers, 5 computers and 3 video cameras; a cinema system with built-in sound and more than 30 movies; a board game kit; an administrative system for reporting information and lending materials; a power plant and a server that generates an internal wireless network to connect the electronic devices of the library and internet access so that the populations of users can access an offering of employment and education.<br>&nbsp;<br>

As for books, the selection was made by a committee comosed of CERLALC, the National Library and the National Network of Public Libraries. In addition to including the titles of a printed basic list, which includes classic authors such as Gabriel García Márquez, a series of pedagogical workshops with the communities and ex-combatants was developed jointly with the Office of the High Commissioner for Peace to find out what they wanted.
<p>
<i>"We realized that above all they wanted books related to topics such as rural development, trades, entrepreneurship, gender, history of Colombia and Latin America"</i> (Henry García)

<br> <i>Mobile Public Libraries reach communities, March 16, 2017</i> </span>
<br>
Although in some cases the territory does not present difficulties, in others it represents an enormous challenge. For example, to arrive to the path to La Florida, in Chocó, the librarian will have to travel first to Quibdó, then move by boat for 6 hours to the municipality of Riosucio, and from there walk for at least two hours on a route that is more or less walkable.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<i>"In Colombia, the colored boxes are called Mobile Public Libraries. They will be in 20 of the 26 <i> "veredas" </i> that host the FARC guerrillas in their transition to civilian life. In these places, each of these Mobile Libraries will lend its services to the community and will carry out the activities of library extension to the camps of the ex-combatants. The culture will be one of the first visible faces in this process of peace ...
<br>
... We stop at a gas station to refill the car, unload our bladders and stretch our legs a little. Fatigue is impossible to conceal, but the desire to reach our destination is greater than exhaustion. The sky, previously dark, is slowly painted with a palette of colors that starts with a soft orange, which briefly turns into a shade of pink that, in turn, is diluted into a very light blue that darkens as one looks up. Dawn is near ... Did the horrible night end? "</i>

<b>"Sin miedo"</b>, composed by <i>Dinastía Vallenata</i> with which they won the 2017 call for stimuli of mobile public libraries.

<i>"The Mobile Public Libraries 'Reading is my story' have become meeting places and have played a decisive role in reconciliation and peace building, as evidenced by the measurement of its social impact that was carried out by the National Center for Consulting. The report reveals how, only between March 1 and October 31, 2017, the innovative library services initiative, which operates in the 20 Territorial Training and Reintegration Spaces, received 176,313 visits to the activities programmed in 176. In addition, 16 writers and journalists advanced Writing and Reading Promotion Workshops with rural communities and ex-combatants.
<br>
These and other surprising data were released on Thursday, November 23 by [who was then] the Director of the National Library of Colombia, Consuelo Gaitán, from Caldono, Cauca, during the presentation of the national evaluation of the entire project, "One year with the Public Mobile Libraries", an initiative that is operating in rural communities and in the camps in which ex-guerrillas have prepared for their transit to civil life, specifically in thirteen departments of the country: Antioquia, Arauca, Caquetá, Cauca, Cesar, Guaviare , Meta, Nariño, Putumayo, Tolima, Chocó, Córdoba and La Guajira. ...
