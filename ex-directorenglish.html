<h2 id="biblioteca-pública-móvil-las-morras">Managing the work</h2>
Interview with Henry on April 10, 2018 at El Espectador in which he signals important points of his coordination in the project.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>How long have you worked with libraries?
</b><br>I started in 2011 at the EPM Library, a very large and important one in Medellín. From there I went on to create a whole process of training for the population, because libraries have traditionally provided the services that we all know, but modern libraries are for more than that. I was in the Public Libraries Network of Antioquia and now in the Ministry of Culture.
</p><p><b>It is a project to take libraries to the rural areas. Where did that idea come from?
</b><br>In the middle of 2016, when the topic of the rural areas began to be known, in the framework of the implementation of the agreements we had to arrive with rapid response strategies to serve these communities and contribute to the process of reincorporation of the FARC guerrillas to civil life. That's when the National Library went to an international ally, which is Libraries Without Borders, to work on a project of mobile public libraries. In March of 2017 we already had 20 public libraries operating in 20 of the 26 rural areas and transitory normalization points that were implemented.
</p><p><b>What contributions does a library make to a neighborhood?
</b><br>We had two objectives in practice. Provide library services, which usually occur in urban centers and cities, and take them to the most difficult areas in Colombia because there are remote libraries with complex road infrastructure conditions and in territories where in many cases the word library in unknown because of the conflict. The other objective was to be able to contribute to the process of reincorporation of the ex-combatants of the FARC.
</p><p><b>How have these mobile libraries  brought the meaning of library to the people?
</b><br>There was an interest in what we were going to take with us, but also ignorance, because they had not had a computer, had not seen a movie on the sidewalk, or what a library is, was technically not known. If you do not know a library, you do not need it, but when it arrives, people realize how important it is. We arrived with a mobile infrastructure and those same communities have been in charge of building fixed spaces. It was with the help of the communities that we could do it, because they themselves generated the resources to build a library.
</p><p><b>Why can't a library have borders?
</b><br>A public library should not have borders or barriers because it is a space for everyone, one that should not discriminate against race, sex, color, ethnicity, culture or social status. Public libraries in Colombia are even some of the spaces that best represent the country's Political Constitution because they are plural, multicultural and open, and they are ready for any Colombian to benefit from everything that happens there.
</p><p><b>The new phase of the project is Public Libraries for the paths of peace.
</b><br>We arrived with 20 libraries to a few villages belonging to municipalities that had been strongly affected by the conflict. When we inaugurated them, the president of the nearby library would arrive to ask why the new library was in that place, if they had also been affected by the conflict. What we did was start making visits and advance community extension services. We managed to reach 176 places last year, by mule, by boat, by motorcycle, by bicycle or by walking.
</p><p><b>How have libraries changed communities?
</b><br>Whenever we talk about culture, we have very nice anecdotal stories. But before entering the territories, we contracted an impact evaluation with the National Consulting Center to compare how the paths change in terms of social capital when a library arrives, that is, how the relationships of the people who live in those areas are strengthened places. We find that a library contributes substantially to strengthening and better recovering the social fabric of these communities that were fractured by the conflict.
</p><p><b>What is the difference of the needs of a library within the city with one that is immersed in a rural area?
</b><br>There are differences in terms of infrastructure, but the main one is based on what you should do. A library in the city like the EPM can work in the development of more specialized services for different publics such as university students or cultural collectives. In the field, the service focus changes because the level of literacy is different. Libraries are called to connect rurality with the urban world in order to meet the needs of the countryside, and that sometimes makes it difficult for them to advance due to the way the field has been.

<br>
In October 2017, the Mobile Public Libraries for Peace project received significant international recognition when it received the <b>2017 ACLEBIM Award in Spain</b>, where it was recognized that this project <i>"transcends the pretension of any cultural facility, by positioning mobile libraries in the center of the effort to build a new country, from development, from knowledge, from concord and, in sum, from all the values inherent in public libraries that inevitably enhance such democratic values as equal opportunities, the critical spirit , life in plurality and, above all, understanding and peace </i>".
</p><p>On December 5, 2017, <i>the Mobile Public Libraries for Peace</i> project won one of the most important awards in Colombia: the 2017 National Award for Senior Management.
</p><p>This important recognition filled the entire team with pride and, as Henry said: <i>"This is a prize for peace, it is a prize for the communities where peace agreements are implemented today, and it is a prize for library work in the areas of most difficult access in the country that were historically affected by the conflict and that today we are reconstructing through the cultural processes that are implemented from public libraries</i>."
</p><p><center>Here the complete team: Congratulations!!<br>
